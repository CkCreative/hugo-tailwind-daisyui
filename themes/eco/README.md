# Hugo, Tailwind CSS and daisyUI starter

Set up so that you only have to run npm start to let both [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and Hugo watch your files.

## Getting started

> You need Hugo installed and available. Test [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) works by running `hugo version`
> You also need [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Confirm these are installed by running `node --version && npm --version`

1. Clone this project and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` and visit `localhost:1313`

Enjoy :rocket:

## Description

The project uses [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run both [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) in one terminal.

[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/) is a lovely Tailwind CSS component library that requires the simplest setup to work with any project that is set up to support Tailwind CSS.
